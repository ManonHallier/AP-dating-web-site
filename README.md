Here, you can find a school project featuring a draft dating site.

Here you will find my school project for a dating site for globetrotters.

The instruction was to create a website by developing all the front end part as well as the back end part. Thus, it was necessary to use HTML, CSS (potentially JavaScript), PHP and SQL.

We had to create a page in which we could find an HTML form, in which the user can enter information, which will be entered in the database, and then, on another page, find the data that had been added to the database.

------------- FILES -------------
- a sql data base creation script
- a sql script that permit to add random people
- all style sheets for all pages
